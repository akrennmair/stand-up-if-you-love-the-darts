# stand-up-if-you-love-the-darts

Two programs for calculating darts checkouts given a total to achieve and a number of darts to achieve it, bearing in mind you have to finish on a double or the bull.

The programs are almost identical except one is written in Python and one is written in C, and one takes an hour to find all of the nine dart checkouts and one takes less than a minute.
